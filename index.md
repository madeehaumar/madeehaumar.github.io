The Winning Playbook is an insightful analysis to explore the performance of NBA teams during the 2021-2022 season. We'll use Tableau to visualize & explore the performance of different basketball teams, and players in a variety of factors, including wins and losses, offensive and defensive efficiency, and individual players' statistics on having the most assists at different positions.

This project provides an in-depth analysis of the healthcare sector, focusing on patient demographics and health information. It examines the typical length of stay, readmission rates, and the correlation between lab procedures and hospitalization duration. Using SQL, we identify racial biases and determine which medical specialties have the highest procedure volumes.

This project shares insights into different countries' transactions in borrowing loans from the World Bank. We will analyze the countries that have borrowed the most loans and how much they owe to IDA.
Using SQL, we get insights into how the countries are spending loan amounts on different ongoing projects and whether they are paying back these loans to IDA.

#### [Massachusettes Education Analysis Using Tableau](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/massachusetts-education-analysis-tableau-madeeha-umar/)
[<img src="images/Thumbnail2.png"/>](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/massachusetts-education-analysis-tableau-madeeha-umar/)
In this analysis, I've helped the education department and School administration to find out helpful insights. We found out how different aspects affect School's graduation rates. We've analyzed using Tableau that if changes are made to inside school's strategies of having bigger or smaller classroom sizes, does it affect the percentage of students who attend college each year? We found some great insights.

This analysis includes the relationship between customers' income and their spending behavior. I analyzed different factors and patterns that can affect their income spent on DoorDash. I visualized the data with the help of Scatter plots, Bar Charts, and histograms.
